# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

http://localhost:8073 {
	# Set this path to your site's directory.
	root * /srv

	# Enable the static file server.
	file_server

	handle_path /*.html {
		root * /srv/www
	}

	handle_path /images/* {
		reverse_proxy minio:8072
		uri replace / /images/
	}

	handle_path /api/* {
		reverse_proxy golang:8074
	}

}
